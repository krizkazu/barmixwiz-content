      "notes": "The Alien Brain Hemorrhage is a layered novelty shot that developed from the earlier Brain Hemorrhage shot, emerging in the early to mid-2000s. It became popular for its eerie, “alien” appearance, created by adding Blue Curaçao to the classic combination of peach schnapps, Baileys, and grenadine, resulting in a green-tinted, curdled brain effect. Rooted more in modern bar trends and viral cocktail culture than in a single place of origin, the drink plays on science-fiction imagery while remaining, at its core, a sweet, fruity, and creamy dessert-style shot.\nVariation named \"Atomic Bomb\":\nChristos Katsoudas’ Atomic Bomb dates back to the late 1980s in Loutraki, Greece, where it was prepared at the Hotel Kontis Studio 44 bar. While the exact origin of the idea is uncertain, one detail is firmly remembered: the drink was finished with a layer of Cointreau, chosen specifically so it could be ignited. The name Atomic Bomb reflected both its visual impact and its dramatic finish.\nFor preparation, peach liqueur was kept in the freezer to achieve greater thickness and density. This was followed by a thin layer of blue curaçao and then Baileys Irish Cream. Using a straw, a few drops of grenadine syrup were added from height, creating a distinct vertical red line through the peach layer. The shot was then topped with Cointreau and carefully set alight.\nThe drink was intended to be consumed quickly through a straw. Caution was essential, as the suction could draw the flame downward along with the liquid.✍️Chris Katsoudas (Lead Developer)",

It replaces the traditional orange and cherry elements with almond liqueur—most commonly amaretto, often produced from apricot kernels—while root beer bitters accentuate the drink’s nutty character. The result is a sweeter, almond-forward interpretation that remains faithful to the foundational whiskey, sugar, and bitters structure.\n\nWhile the twist itself is modern, its lineage reaches back to the earliest definition of a “cocktail” in 1806, with the term Old Fashioned emerging in the 1880s to describe the straightforward whiskey cocktail from which this variation ultimately evolved.",

      "notes": "The AMF closely resembles a Long Island Iced Tea, with the main difference being the use of blue curaçao and lemon-lime soda instead of triple sec and cola.\nThe Adios, Motherfucker (AMF) has no definitive creator, but it is generally believed to have originated in the United States during the late 1980s or early 1990s. Essentially a variation of the Long Island Iced Tea with a few ingredient substitutions, it gained popularity in nightclubs for its high alcohol content, electric-blue color from blue curaçao, and deliberately provocative name. The name reflects the era’s shock-value cocktail trends and humorously suggests that one strong drink might be enough to end the night early.",

First documented in Jerry Thomas’s 1862 guide, it is distinguished by its sugared rim—known as the “crusta”—and an oversized citrus peel lining the glass. Built with brandy, orange curaçao, lemon juice, maraschino liqueur, and bitters, the drink balances sharp acidity with aromatic sweetness, with the sugar rim intentionally moderating each sip. Its structure and presentation directly influenced later classics such as the Sidecar.",

The drink became an emblem of the disco era—approachable, sweet, and easy to drink—though it was often dismissed as lacking sophistication.\n\nWhile amaretto itself has Italian roots stretching back centuries, the cocktail’s modern identity was shaped by this American marketing push. In recent years, bartenders have revived the Amaretto Sour by incorporating fresh citrus, bourbon, and egg white, transforming it into a richer, more balanced, and complex interpretation of the original.",

Ahead of the broader martini revival in the early 2000s, sake began to appear more frequently as a cocktail base, alongside an expanding use of the term “martini” to describe a wide range of mixed drinks. While some traditionalists argue that the saketini undermines the classic gin-and-vermouth formula, others have embraced it as a legitimate evolution. Mixologist Lucy Brennan has been a vocal supporter, developing numerous sake-based cocktails, and Benihana founder Hiroaki Aoki has similarly defended the concept, noting that if a sake cocktail is enjoyable, tradition should not hinder innovation.
