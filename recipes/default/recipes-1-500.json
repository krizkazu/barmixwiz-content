      "notes": "The AMF closely resembles a Long Island Iced Tea, with the main difference being the use of blue curaçao and lemon-lime soda instead of triple sec and cola.\nThe Adios, Motherfucker (AMF) has no definitive creator, but it is generally believed to have originated in the United States during the late 1980s or early 1990s. Essentially a variation of the Long Island Iced Tea with a few ingredient substitutions, it gained popularity in nightclubs for its high alcohol content, electric-blue color from blue curaçao, and deliberately provocative name. The name reflects the era’s shock-value cocktail trends and humorously suggests that one strong drink might be enough to end the night early.",

First documented in Jerry Thomas’s 1862 guide, it is distinguished by its sugared rim—known as the “crusta”—and an oversized citrus peel lining the glass. Built with brandy, orange curaçao, lemon juice, maraschino liqueur, and bitters, the drink balances sharp acidity with aromatic sweetness, with the sugar rim intentionally moderating each sip. Its structure and presentation directly influenced later classics such as the Sidecar.",

The drink became an emblem of the disco era—approachable, sweet, and easy to drink—though it was often dismissed as lacking sophistication.\n\nWhile amaretto itself has Italian roots stretching back centuries, the cocktail’s modern identity was shaped by this American marketing push. In recent years, bartenders have revived the Amaretto Sour by incorporating fresh citrus, bourbon, and egg white, transforming it into a richer, more balanced, and complex interpretation of the original.",

Ahead of the broader martini revival in the early 2000s, sake began to appear more frequently as a cocktail base, alongside an expanding use of the term “martini” to describe a wide range of mixed drinks. While some traditionalists argue that the saketini undermines the classic gin-and-vermouth formula, others have embraced it as a legitimate evolution. Mixologist Lucy Brennan has been a vocal supporter, developing numerous sake-based cocktails, and Benihana founder Hiroaki Aoki has similarly defended the concept, noting that if a sake cocktail is enjoyable, tradition should not hinder innovation.
